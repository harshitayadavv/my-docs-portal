title: Life Expectancy Prediction
---

# 🧬 Life Expectancy Prediction — ML Regression Project

This project predicts **life expectancy** using **machine learning regression models** trained on various health, demographic, and economic indicators.

---

## 🚀 Objective
To analyze which socio-economic factors most strongly affect life expectancy across different countries and build an accurate predictive model.

---

## 🧠 Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
3. **Model Training:** Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVR  
4. **Evaluation:** R² Score, MSE, RMSE  

---

## 📊 Insights
- Higher **immunization rate** and **GDP per capita** correlate with longer life expectancy  
- **Alcohol consumption** and **HIV rate** are strong negative predictors  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 💡 Learnings
- Regression model comparison and evaluation  
- Feature importance and correlation analysis  
- Visual storytelling through data
